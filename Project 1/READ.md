### Overview
<p>Predicting stock values is a fun and potentially lucrative endeavour.  This project is my own attempt to forecast future values of the 
Vanguard 500 using historical economic indicator data.</p>

### Data
<p>The dataset is a combination of data from several sources, including Yahoo Finance, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the International 
Monetary Fund, and the OECD.  The response variable is the price of the Vanguard 500, which is a proxy for the value of the stock market.  
There are five (5) predictors in the dataset (Producer Price Index for Rail Transportation, Price of Oil, 
Price of Gold, Consumer Confidence Indexm and the Consumer Price Index) with observations beginning in January 2001 and ending in August of 2020.  
There are 236 observations in total.</p>  

### Model
<p>The model I used is a linear regression model.</p>
