### Overview:
<p>This is a unsupervised machine learning project that attempts to aid students who are applying to college find schools that meet their criteria for a good school.  Students seeking a degree from a post-secondary educational instuition face a choice among thousands of potential schools.  These schools range in cost from tens of thousands of dollars to hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Some specialize in art, others focus on the trades, while some focus on technical areas.  And, if you're seeking a diverse college experience, how do you make sure that you don't end up in a place that is caters to mostly white, rich kids?  This project seeks to aid students making the difficult decision of where to go to college by grouping like schools together.  In theory if the groups are good enough, a student could research and visit a group of schools, pick their favorite and then refer back to the models output to find similar schools.</p>

### Goals:
<ol>
<li>Work with a challenging data set that requires preprocessing</li>
<li>Group Colleges in a meaningful way</li>
<li>Gain Experience with unsupervised machine learning</li>
</ol>

### Motivation and Background
<p>  If you're a high school student interested in going to college, how do you choose which school your going to go to?

    <li><b>Author/Reason for Creation:</b> Data World created this data set "as a resource for instructors to integrate into coursework or for individuals looking for practice opportunities."<\li>
    <li><b>Size:</b>  7804x1725 -- 7804 schools with 1725 Data Elements<\li>
    <li><b>Suitability:</b> The data set is a good source for solving this problem because it has a comprehensive list of post-secondary schools and a fairly large set of real number data elements that can be used to group the schools.<\li>
        <li><b>Data Dictionary:</b> The Data Dictionary for the data elements used in the project can be found at the end of the Exploratory Data Analysis workbook.</li></ul>
